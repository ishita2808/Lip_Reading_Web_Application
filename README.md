# Lip_Reading_Web_Application
A deep learning-based system that interprets spoken language by analyzing lip movements from silent videos. This project uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and sequence models (LSTM/Transformer) to convert visual speech into text, providing accessibility and enhancing communication in audio-restricted environments.
